Hello! Welcome to my humble github, I am Benjamin Gramsch and I'll be your guide

MSc. in Spatial, Transport and Environmental Economics

My main interest is to use spatial and statistical analysis in combination with Machine Learning to create more sustainable and equitable cities

 I am currently working on a microsimulation of Santiago's mobility using Eclipse Sumo, if you are interested please check it out, I am always open for new ideas!
